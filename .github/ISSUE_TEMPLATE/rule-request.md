### New rule request

Please describe the rule idea, format
this issue's title as `Rule Request: [Rule Name]` and describe:

1. Why should this rule be added? Share links to existing discussion about what
   the community thinks about this.
2. Provide several examples of what _would_ and _wouldn't_ trigger violations.
3. Should the rule be configurable, if so what parameters should be configurable?
4. Should the rule be opt-in or enabled by default? Why?
   See [README.md](../README.md#opt-in-rules) for guidelines on when to mark a rule as opt-in.
