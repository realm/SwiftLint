## 0.11.1: Cuddles... Or Else!

##### Breaking

* None.

##### Enhancements

* Added `statement_mode` configuration to  the `statement_position` rule. The   
  `default` mode keeps the current SwiftLint behavior of keeping `else` and
  `catch` statements on the same line as the closing brace before them. The
  `uncuddled_else`configuration requires the `else` and `catch` to be on a new
  line with the same leading whitespace as the brace.  
  [Mike Skiba](https://github.com/ateliercw)
  [#651](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/651)

##### Bug Fixes

  Guidelines.  
  [Jorge Bernal](https://github.com/koke)
  [#654](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/654)

* Embedding frameworks needed by `swiftlint` was moved from
  SwiftLintFramework Xcode target to the swiftlint target.
  The `SwiftLintFramework.framework` product built by the
  SwiftLintFramework target no longer contains unnecessary frameworks or
  multiple copies of the Swift libraries.  
  [Norio Nomura](https://github.com/norio-nomura)

##### Enhancements

* Add `--format` option to `autocorrect` command which re-indents Swift files
  much like pasting into Xcode would. This option isn't currently configurable,
  but that can change if users request it.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)

* Improve error messages for invalid configuration files.  
  [Brian Hardy](https://github.com/lyricsboy)

* Added the user-configurable option `ignores_empty_lines` to the
  `trailing_whitespace` rule. It can be used to control whether the
  `TrailingWhitespaceRule` should report and correct whitespace-indented empty
  lines. Defaults to `false`. Added unit tests.  
  [Reimar Twelker](https://github.com/raginmari)

##### Bug Fixes

  or an if statement with two case tests.  
  [Andrew Rahn](https://github.com/paddlefish)

* Fix regression in CommaRule ignoring violations when the comma is followed
  by a comment.  
  [Norio Nomura](https://github.com/norio-nomura)
  [#683](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/683)

## 0.10.0: `laundry-select` edition

##### Breaking

* None.

##### Enhancements

* Now `libclang.dylib` and `sourcekitd.framework` are dynamically loaded at
  runtime by SourceKittenFramework to use the versions included in the Xcode
  version specified by `xcode-select -p` or custom toolchains.  
  [Norio Nomura](https://github.com/norio-nomura)
  [#167](https://github.com/jpsim/SourceKitten/issues/167)

* Add `LegacyCGGeometryFunctionsRule` rule.  
  [Sarr Blaise](https://github.com/bsarr007)
  [#625](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/625)

* SwiftLint no longer crashes when SourceKitService crashes.  
  [Norio Nomura](https://github.com/norio-nomura)

* Rewrite `conditional_binding_cascade` rule.  
  [Norio Nomura](https://github.com/norio-nomura)
  [#617](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/617)

  [Josh Friend](https://github.com/joshfriend)
  [#592](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/592)

* `LegacyConstantRule` and `LegacyConstructorRule` failed to `autocorrect`.  
  [Norio Nomura](https://github.com/norio-nomura)
  [#623](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/623)

## 0.9.2: Multiple Exhaust Codes

##### Breaking

* None.

##### Enhancements

* Return different exit codes to distinguish between types of errors:
  * 0: No errors, maybe warnings in non-strict mode
  * 1: Usage or system error
  * 2: Style violations of severity "Error"
  * 3: No style violations of severity "Error", but violations of severity
       "warning" with `--strict`  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)
  [#166](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/166)

* `VariableNameRule` now accepts symbols starting with more than one uppercase
  letter to allow for names like XMLString or MIMEType.

  has been renamed to a free function: `reporterFromString(_:)`.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)

* `_ConfigProviderRule` & `ConfigurableRule` have been removed and their
  requirements have been moved to `Rule`.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)

* `Configuration(path:optional:silent)` has been changed to
  `Configuration(path:rootPath:optional:quiet:)`.

  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)
  [#479](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/479)

  `use_nested_configs` configuration key are unaffected.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)

* The `use_nested_configs` configuration key has been deprecated and its value
  is now ignored. Nested configuration files are now always considered.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)

##### Enhancements

  overrides existing `reporter` values in the configuration file. Choose between
  `xcode` (default), `json`, `csv` or `checkstyle`.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)

  or `max_length`.
