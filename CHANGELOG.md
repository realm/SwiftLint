## Master

#### Breaking

* None.

#### Experimental

* None.

#### Enhancements

* Add `deployment_target` rule to validate that `@availability` attributes and
  `#available` conditions are not using a version that is satisfied by the
  deployment target. Since SwiftLint can't read an Xcode project, you need to
  configure this rule with these keys: `iOS_deployment_target`,
  `macOS_deployment_target`, `watchOS_deployment_target` and
  `tvOS_deployment_target`. By default, these values are configured with the
  minimum versions supported by Swift.  
  [Marcelo Fabri](https://github.com/marcelofabri)
  [#2589](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/2589)

  full type-checked AST. Rules of the `AnalyzerRule` type will be added over
  time. The compiler log path containing the clean `swiftc` build command
  invocation (incremental builds will fail) must be passed to `analyze` via

## 0.18.1: Misaligned Drum

##### Breaking

* None.

##### Enhancements

* None.

##### Bug Fixes

* Compile releases in the 'Release' configuration rather than 'Debug'.

## 0.18.0: Misaligned Drum

##### Breaking

* Replace YamlSwift with Yams. SwiftLint no longer includes YamlSwift. If your
  project implicitly depends on YamlSwift, you need to modify it to depend on
  YamlSwift explicitly.  
  [norio-nomura](https://github.com/norio-nomura)
  [#1412](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/1412)

* Yams interprets YAML more strictly than YamlSwift, so if your YAML
  configurations previously worked with SwiftLint but didn't fully conform to
  the YAML 1.2 standard, you'll need to fix those validation errors.
  For example:
  ```yaml
  custom_rules:
    wrong_regex:
      name: "wrong regex"
      regex: "((assert|precondition)\(false)" # '\' in "" means escape sequence
    strict_regex:
      name: "strict regex"
      regex: '((assert|precondition)\(false)' # Use single quotes
  ```

##### Enhancements

* Support compiling with Xcode 8.3 and Swift 3.1.  
  [Keith Smiley](https://github.com/keith)

* Fix false positives on `for_where` rule and skip violation on
  complex conditions.  
  [Marcelo Fabri](https://github.com/marcelofabri)
  [#1387](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/1387)

* Print YAML configuration errors in locatable format compatible with Xcode's
  Issue Navigator.

  instead of a single `if` expression inside the loop.  
  [Marcelo Fabri](https://github.com/marcelofabri)
  [#1228](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/1228)

* `unused_enumerated` rule now warns when only the index is being used.
  You should use `.indices` instead of `.enumerated()` in this case.

  [Marcelo Fabri](https://github.com/marcelofabri)
  [#946](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/946)

* Add `attributes` opt-in rule which validates if an attribute (`@objc`,
  `@IBOutlet`, `@discardableResult`, etc) is in the right position:
    - If the attribute is `@IBAction` or `@NSManaged`, it should always be on
    the same line as the declaration
    - If the attribute has parameters, it should always be on the line above
    the declaration
    - Otherwise:
      - if the attribute is applied to a variable, it should be on the same line
      - if it's applied to a type or function, it should be on the line above
      - if it's applied to an import (the only option is `@testable import`),
      it should be on the same line.
  You can also configure what attributes should be always on a new line or on

## 0.11.1: Cuddles... Or Else!

##### Breaking

* None.

##### Enhancements

* Added `statement_mode` configuration to  the `statement_position` rule. The   
  `default` mode keeps the current SwiftLint behavior of keeping `else` and
  `catch` statements on the same line as the closing brace before them. The
  `uncuddled_else`configuration requires the `else` and `catch` to be on a new
  line with the same leading whitespace as the brace.  
  [Mike Skiba](https://github.com/ateliercw)
  [#651](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/651)

  Guidelines.  
  [Jorge Bernal](https://github.com/koke)
  [#654](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/654)

* Embedding frameworks needed by `swiftlint` was moved from
  SwiftLintFramework Xcode target to the swiftlint target.
  The `SwiftLintFramework.framework` product built by the
  SwiftLintFramework target no longer contains unnecessary frameworks or
  multiple copies of the Swift libraries.  
  [Norio Nomura](https://github.com/norio-nomura)

##### Enhancements

* Add `--format` option to `autocorrect` command which re-indents Swift files
  much like pasting into Xcode would. This option isn't currently configurable,
  but that can change if users request it.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)

* Improve error messages for invalid configuration files.  
  [Brian Hardy](https://github.com/lyricsboy)

* Added the user-configurable option `ignores_empty_lines` to the
  `trailing_whitespace` rule. It can be used to control whether the
  `TrailingWhitespaceRule` should report and correct whitespace-indented empty
  lines. Defaults to `false`. Added unit tests.  
  [Reimar Twelker](https://github.com/raginmari)

##### Bug Fixes

* Fix false positive in conditional binding cascade violation.  
  [Norio Nomura](https://github.com/norio-nomura)

  version specified by `xcode-select -p` or custom toolchains.  
  [Norio Nomura](https://github.com/norio-nomura)
  [#167](https://github.com/jpsim/SourceKitten/issues/167)

  [#623](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/623)

## 0.9.2: Multiple Exhaust Codes

##### Breaking

* None.

##### Enhancements

* Return different exit codes to distinguish between types of errors:
  * 0: No errors, maybe warnings in non-strict mode
  * 1: Usage or system error
  * 2: Style violations of severity "Error"
  * 3: No style violations of severity "Error", but violations of severity
       "warning" with `--strict`  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)
  [#166](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/166)

## 0.9.0: Appliance Maintenance

##### Breaking

* `Linter.reporter` has been removed and `Configuration.reporterFromString(_:)`
  has been renamed to a free function: `reporterFromString(_:)`.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)

* `_ConfigProviderRule` & `ConfigurableRule` have been removed and their
  requirements have been moved to `Rule`.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)

* `Configuration(path:optional:silent)` has been changed to
  `Configuration(path:rootPath:optional:quiet:)`.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)

* The static function `Configuration.rulesFromDict(_:ruleList:)` has been moved
  to an instance method: `RuleList.configuredRulesWithDictionary(_:)`.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)

* The `rules` parameter in the `Configuration` initializer has been renamed to
  `configuredRules`.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)

* Removed a large number of declarations from the public SwiftLintFramework API.
  This is being done to minimize the API surface area in preparation of a 1.0
  release. See [#507](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/pull/507) for a
  complete record of this change.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)
  [#479](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/479)

* All instances of the abbreviation "config" in the API have been expanded to
  "configuration". The `--config` command line parameter and
  `use_nested_configs` configuration key are unaffected.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)

* The `use_nested_configs` configuration key has been deprecated and its value
  is now ignored. Nested configuration files are now always considered.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)

##### Enhancements

* `swiftlint lint` now accepts an optional `--reporter` parameter which
  overrides existing `reporter` values in the configuration file. Choose between
  `xcode` (default), `json`, `csv` or `checkstyle`.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)
  [#440](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/440)

* `swiftlint rules` now shows a configuration description for all rules.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)

  status messages like 'Linting <file>' & 'Done linting' from being logged.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)
  [#386](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/386)

* All top-level keys in a configuration file that accept an array now also
  accept a single value.  
  e.g. `included: Source` is equivalent to `included:\n  - Source`.  
  [JP Simard](https://github.com/jpsim)
