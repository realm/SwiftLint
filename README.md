# SwiftLint

Note: We have modified this to be a little less strict on whitespace and line length.

An experimental tool to enforce Swift style and conventions, loosely based on
[GitHub's Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/github/swift-style-guide).

SwiftLint hooks into [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org) and
[SourceKit](http://www.jpsim.com/uncovering-sourcekit) to use the
[AST](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/IntroductionToTheClangAST.html) representation
of your source files for more accurate results.

![Test Status](https://travis-ci.org/realm/SwiftLint.svg?branch=master)

## Installation

Using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

```
brew install swiftlint
```

You can also install SwiftLint by downloading `SwiftLint.pkg` from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/releases/latest) and running it.

You can also build from source by cloning this project and running `make install`.

## Usage

### Xcode

Integrate SwiftLint into an Xcode scheme to get warnings and errors displayed
in the IDE. Just add a new "Run Script Phase" with `/usr/local/bin/swiftlint`
as its contents.

### Atom

To integrate SwiftLint with [Atom](https://atom.io/) install the
[`linter-swiftlint`](https://atom.io/packages/linter-swiftlint) package from APM.

### Command Line

```
$ swiftlint help
Available commands:

   help      Display general or command-specific help
   lint      Print lint warnings and errors for the Swift files in the current directory (default command)
   rules     Display the list of rules and examples
   version   Display the current version of SwiftLint
```

Run `swiftlint` in the directory containing the Swift files to lint. Directories
will be searched recursively.

## Rules

There are only a small number of rules currently implemented, but we hope the
Swift community (that's you!) will contribute more over time. Pull requests are
encouraged.

The rules that *are* currently implemented are mostly there as a starting point
and are subject to change.

See the [Source/SwiftLintFramework/Rules](Source/SwiftLintFramework/Rules) directory to see the currently
implemented rules.
