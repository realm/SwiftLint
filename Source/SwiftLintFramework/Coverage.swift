import Foundation

/// Collects and reports coverage statistics.
///
/// Coverage is defined as the sum of the number of rules applied to each line of input, divided by the product of the
/// number of input lines and the total number of rules.
///
/// If all rules are applied to every input line, then coverage would be `1` (or 100%). If half the rules are applied
/// to all input lines, or if all the rules are applied to half of the input lines, then coverage would be `0.5`, and
/// if no rules are enabled, or there is no input, then coverage would be zero.
///
/// No distinction is made between actual lines of Swift source, versus blank lines or comments, as SwiftLint may
/// apply rules to those as well. Coverage is only calculated over input files, so if you exclude files in your
/// configuration, they will be ignored. Empty input files, or files containing a single empty line will be ignored, as
/// SwiftLint ignores these files automatically.
///
/// "All rules" can be defined either as *all enabled rules*, **or** *all available rules, enabled or not*, resulting
/// in two different coverage metrics:
///
/// * "Enabled rules coverage" measures how frequently enabled rules are being disabled by `swiftlint:disable`
///   commands.
/// * "All rules coverage" measures how many of all possible rules are actually being applied.
///
/// Typically, enabled rules coverage will be close to `1`,  as `swiftlint:disable` is used sparingly. All rules
/// coverage will generally be much lower, as some rules are contradictory, and many rules are optin. With no opt-in
/// rules enabled, all rules coverage will be about `0.4`, rising to `0.8` or more if many opt-in rules are enabled.
///
/// When calculating all rules coverage `swiftlint:disable` commands are still accounted for, but only for enabled
/// rules.
///
/// Coverage figures will be different for linting and analyzing as these use different sets of rules.
///
/// The number of enabled rules is determined on a per-file basis, so child and local configurations will be accounted
/// for.
///
/// Custom rules, if enabledÂ and defined, will be counted as first class rules for both enabled and all rules coverage.
/// If not enabled, `custom_rules` will be counted as a single rule, even if a configuration exists for it.
///
/// When calculating enabled rules coverage, the custom rules in the configuration for each input file (e.g. including
/// child configurations) will be taken into account. When calculating all rules coverage, only the main configurations
/// custom rules settings will be used.
